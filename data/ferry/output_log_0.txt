action: sail
parameters: [?from, ?to]
preconditions of sail: ?from is not equal to ?to and ?from is a location and ?to is a location and ?from is at the ferry and ?from is an object and ?to is an object
effects of sail: it becomes true that ?to is at the ferry and it is not the case anymore that ?from is at the ferry -> sail {location ?from} to {location ?to}
action: board
parameters: [?car, ?loc]
preconditions of board: ?car is a car and ?loc is a location and ?car is at ?loc and ?loc is at the ferry and the ferry is empty and ?car is an object and ?loc is an object
effects of board: it becomes true that ?car is on and it is not the case anymore that ?car is at ?loc and the ferry is empty -> board {car ?car} from {location ?loc} onto the ferry
action: debark
parameters: [?car, ?loc]
preconditions of debark: ?car is a car and ?loc is a location and ?car is on and ?loc is at the ferry and ?car is an object and ?loc is an object
effects of debark: it becomes true that ?car is at ?loc and the ferry is empty and it is not the case anymore that ?car is on -> debark {car ?car} at {location ?loc}
